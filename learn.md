By coding a marble maze game with your Raspberry Pi and Sense HAT, you will learn:

- How to illuminate Sense HAT pixels
- How to capture pitch, roll, and yaw data
- How to implement a basic form of collision detection

This resource covers elements from the following strands of the [Raspberry Pi Digital Making Curriculum](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/):

- [Design basic 2D and 3D assets](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/design/creator)
- [Combine programming constructs to solve a problem](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/programming/builder)
- [Process input data to monitor or react to the environment](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/physical-computing/developer)
