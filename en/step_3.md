## Sense Hat Marble Maze

A marble maze is a game of skill and dexterity: one or more marbles are placed inside a maze, and the player guides them to a specific point by tilting the maze in various directions, causing the marbles to roll around.

Given that the Sense HAT is capable of reporting its exact orientation and has an in-built 8x8 pixel LED display, it is the perfect device with which to create an electronic marble maze game.
