## What you will make
In this activity you will create a marble maze game that can be played on the LED matrix of your Sense HAT. You will use the in-built orientation sensors of the Sense HAT to control the movement of the marble, simulating the way a real marble rolls around a maze.

## What you will learn
By coding a marble maze game with your Raspberry Pi and Sense HAT, you will learn:

- How to illuminate Sense HAT pixels
- How to capture pitch, roll, and yaw data
- How to implement a basic form of collision detection
