## Introduction

In this activity you will create a marble maze game that can be played on the LED matrix of your Sense HAT. You will use the in-built orientation sensors of the Sense HAT to control the movement of the marble, simulating the way a real marble rolls around a maze.

### What you will make

Here is an example of a marble maze game. Press the "Run" button to see it in action.

Click and drag on the Sense HAT emulator to move the Sense HAT around. As you change the position of the Sense HAT, the marble on the display will move around.

### What you will learn
By coding a marble maze game with your Raspberry Pi and Sense HAT, you will learn:

- How to illuminate Sense HAT pixels
- How to capture pitch, roll, and yaw data
- How to implement a basic form of collision detection
