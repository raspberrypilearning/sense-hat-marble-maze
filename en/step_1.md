## Introduction

In this activity you will create a marble maze game that can be played on the LED matrix of your Sense HAT. You will use the in-built orientation sensors of the Sense HAT to control the movement of a simulated marble that moves the same way a real marble would roll around a maze.

### What you will make

Here is an example of a marble maze game running on the Sense HAT emulator. Press the **Run** button to see it in action.

Click and drag the emulated Sense HAT to move it around. As you change the position of the Sense HAT, the marble on the display moves around.

### What you will learn
By coding a marble maze game with your Raspberry Pi and Sense HAT, you will learn how to:

- Illuminate Sense HAT pixels
- Capture pitch, roll, and yaw data with the Sense HAT's orientation sensors
- Implement a basic form of collision detection
